# Requirements of Election of Candidates
Prior to e-Voting System design, a comprehensive and detailed set of requirements have been developed. These requirements are divided into two groups, namely, generic and system-specific. The generic requirements are those requirements that apply to any voting system.

# Functional Requirements
# Convenience: 
The system shall allow the voters to cast their votes quickly, in one session, and should not require many special skills or intimidate the voter (to ensure Equality of Access to Voters).
# User-Interface: 
The system shall provide an easy-to-use user-interface. Also, it shall not disadvantage any candidate while displaying the choices (e.g., by requiring the user to scroll down to see the last few choices).
# Transparency: 
Voters should be able to possess a general knowledge and understanding of the voting process.
# Support for Disabled Voters: 
The system shall cater to the needs of physically challenged voters (e.g. blind voters).
# Accuracy: 
The system shall record and count all the votes and shall do so correctly.
# Eligibility: 
Only authorized voters, who are registered, should be able to vote.
# Uniqueness: 
No voter should be able to vote more than once. 

The system-specific requirements, are those requirements that are specific to the electronic-voting systems. 

The system-specific requirements include: 

• Multi-user: a number of voters can vote simultaneously; 
• Multi-campaign: a number of elections can be running simultaneously;  
• Accessibility: the system can be accessed  by voters from any location using secure Internet and/or mobile devices;  
• Availability: the system must have high-availability during an election campaign.
