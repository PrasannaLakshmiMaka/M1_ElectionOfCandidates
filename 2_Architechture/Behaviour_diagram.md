# Behaviour Diagram
* UML Behavioral Diagrams depict the elements of a system that are dependent on time and that convey the dynamic concepts of the system and how they relate to each other. The elements in these diagrams resemble the verbs in a natural language and the relationships that connect them typically convey the passage of time.

# Use Case Diagram
* Use Case diagrams capture Use Cases and relationships among Actors and the system; they describes the functional requirements of the system, the manner in which external operators interact at the system boundary, and the response of the system.

# Flowchart
* Activity diagram is another important diagram in UML to describe the dynamic aspects of the system. Activity diagram is basically a flowchart to represent the flow from one activity to another activity.
